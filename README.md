### Project 1: Exploring Array Manipulation in JavaScript

#### Objective
The aim of this assignment is to familiarize students with various array manipulation techniques in JavaScript, including adding and removing elements, transforming arrays, and applying array methods.

#### Problem Statement
Create a JavaScript program that demonstrates different array manipulation operations, covering adding and removing elements, sorting arrays, applying array methods such as map, filter, and reduce, and exploring the spread and rest operators.

#### Tasks

1. **Adding and Removing Elements**
    - Create an array containing some initial elements.
    - Use the `push` method to add a new element to the end of the array.
    - Use the `pop` method to remove the last element from the array.
    ```javascript
    let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
    ```

2. **Sorting Arrays**
    - Create an array of numbers in random order.
    - Use the `sort` method to sort the array in ascending order.
    ```javascript
    let numbers = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4];
    ```

3. **Applying Array Methods**
    - Create an array of numbers.
    - Use the `map` method to double each number in the array.
    - Use the `filter` method to filter out even numbers from the array.
    - Use the `reduce` method to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array.
    ```javascript
    let numbers = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4];
    ```

#### Expected Outcomes
Students should gain a thorough understanding of array manipulation techniques in JavaScript, including adding and removing elements, sorting arrays, and applying array methods such as map, filter, and reduce. They should also be familiar with using the spread and rest operators for array manipulation.

### Project 2: Exploring String Manipulation in JavaScript

#### Objective
The aim of this assignment is to acquaint students with various string manipulation techniques in JavaScript, including string length, case conversion, substring extraction, and string splitting.

#### Problem Statement
Create a JavaScript program that demonstrates different string manipulation operations, covering obtaining the length of a string, converting cases (upper and lower), extracting substrings, and splitting strings based on a delimiter.

#### Tasks

1. **Obtaining String Length**
    - Create a string with some text content.
    - Use the `length` property to obtain the length of the string.
    ```javascript
    let message = "Hello, World!";
    ```

2. **Converting Cases**
    - Create a string with mixed-case content.
    - Use the `toUpperCase` method to convert the string to uppercase.
    - Use the `toLowerCase` method to convert the string to lowercase.
    ```javascript
    let text = "Hello, World!";
    ```

3. **Extracting Substrings**
    - Create a string with some text content.
    - Use the `substring` method to extract a substring from the original string.
    ```javascript
    let sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
    ```

4. **Splitting Strings**
    - Create a string containing multiple words separated by spaces.
    - Use the `split` method to split the string into an array of words based on the space delimiter.
    ```javascript
    let sentence = "The quick brown fox";
    ```

#### Expected Outcomes
Students should be proficient in various string manipulation techniques in JavaScript, including obtaining string length, converting cases, extracting substrings, and splitting strings. They should also understand when and how to apply these techniques in practical programming scenarios.
